- Mobile fixes keep brutalist yellow design intact
- Triple Engine now complete: Find → Chase → Win — all built and working

### Next Loop Priorities
1. Twilio WhatsApp key setup — make Chase/Win engines live (needs `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` + `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`)
2. Stripe live keys + webhook deployment — activate checkout
3. Root ErrorBoundary for App.tsx (stability)
4. AgentDock MVP: ServiceNow connector + Review Gate + audit log
5. Land Registry signal integration (already in vault — not yet built)
6. Companies House signal (built, key-gated — needs API key)
7. Weekly trade-signal feed logic (SEO + engagement)
8. PlanWire integration (fresh planning alerts + webhooks)

### Rule
- Every feature must fit into Triple Engine: Find → Chase → Win
- If it doesn't, don't build it
- Obsidian vault is source of truth — keep it clean
